  Executive Summary

  AI Rent Collector is an intelligent automation platform that transforms rent collection from a manual, reactive process into a proactive, AI-driven system. The product uses Large Language
  Models (LLMs) and vector databases to generate personalized tenant communications, predict payment risks, and optimize collection strategies while preserving positive landlord-tenant
  relationships.

  Key Value Propositions:
  - 80% reduction in manual rent collection time
  - 25-40% improvement in on-time payment rates
  - 50% reduction in tenant communication conflicts
  - Scalable automation supporting 100+ units per property manager

  Problem Statement

  Property managers currently spend 15-20 hours weekly on rent collection, using generic communication templates that often damage tenant relationships. This reactive approach results in:
  - 5-8% annual rent loss due to collection inefficiencies
  - High tenant turnover from poor communication experiences
  - Inability to scale operations without proportional staff increases
  - Missed opportunities for early intervention on at-risk accounts

  Market Opportunity: $2.8B+ annually in the US property management software market, with 87% of property managers reporting collection inefficiencies as a top operational challenge.
